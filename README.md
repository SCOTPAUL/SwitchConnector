SwitchConnector
===============

Every time you connect a Nintendo Switch Pro controller to the Switch, you have to unpair and re-pair it with your PC again to use it for games on Windows.

This small program just unpairs and re-pairs the controller automatically to avoid jumping through UI hoops.

Note to self, never try to use Win32 from Rust again.
